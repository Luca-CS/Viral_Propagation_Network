## Context

Artefact is a digital marketing agency created in 1998 with more than 25 locations in 18 countries. It's headquarters are located in Paris.

Greenpeace has reiched out to Artefact in order to conceiv a viral marketing compaign in order to raise awarness about climate change.

A fake company called Orizon was created. Its proposal is to find houses that will be located on the futur waterfront by 2100 due to the rizing level of oceans. It supposedly uses data from IPCC ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) and NASA ( National aeronautics and space administration).

The goal is obviously to shock the people due to the cynism of the campain, and hope for a viral diffusion on the internet.

## Description

Artefact has launched the campain on Instagram, and acquired some data on the diffusion of the video.

Our goal is to exploit the given dataset in order to acheive several goals:
- assess the effectiveness of the current campain
- understand the underlying mecanism behind the viral spread of a post on social networks.
- come up with a refinement of the strategy to improve its efficiency
- estimate the pros and cons of the new strategy
